   EO_Canopy_2021_v2.csv, EO_Harvest_Wife_2021.csv, Week_11_Code.R

2. Include a paragraph on your learning experience and feedback for future students in the repository README.MD.
   I found the course to be highly helpful in making me more comfortable and confident with using the R programming language. Each module was well-organized
   with assigned readings, practice problems, and assignment exercises. I would recommend for future students to take this course after they have taken
   STA 6093 Intro to Applied Statistics and finished collecting their own data.
